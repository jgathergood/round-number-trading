\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we use detailed daily-level data from an online stockbroking service to show that investors are significantly more likely to sell stocks following a change in the left-digit of the stock price. This increased probability of sale occurs both for stock crossing a left-digit from below, as the stock price increases, and for stocks crossing a left-digit from above, as the stock price falls.

Our results are consistent with investors focusing their attention on the leftmost digit of the stock price and paying less attention to the following digits. The behaviour we observe results from investors' responses to changes in left-digits as not due to investors choosing round number values as strike prices for limit orders. When we control for limit orders, removing trades from the sample that are most likely to be placed with limit orders, our main results are unchanged.

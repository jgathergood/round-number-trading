\subsection*{The Left-Digit Effect and Stock Trading Behavior}

Investors are more likely to sell stocks after a change in the left-digit. This occurs for both price increases and decreases. The likelihood of a stock being sold jumps when the price crosses the left-digit from below, e.g. a stock increasing from \pounds9 to \pounds10, and also increases when the price crosses the left-digit from above, e.g. a stock decreasing from \pounds10 to \pounds9. We interpret this as showing that investor attention is drawn to stocks that change their leftmost digit. Left-digit changes are attention grabbing, causing sale activity. This is similar to the rank effect finding of Hartzmark (2012), whereby either top-ranked or bottom-ranked stocks by return since purchase are those most likely to be sold.

To show our result, we draw a sample of stock $\times$ quarters that have increased in value through a left-digit in a calendar quarter (e.g. Jan - Mar), which we call the Price Increasing Sample. We then draw a sample of stocks that have decreased in value through a left-digit in a calendar quarter, which we call the Price Decreasing Sample. Note, this sample restriction is at the stock $\times$ quarter level.

We then draw all investor $\times$ stock $\times$ days within the Price Increasing Sample and the Price Decreasing Sample, i.e. all observations for investors $\times$ days on which the investor held the stock at the beginning of the day. We look at the probability of sale when the stock is just below a left-digit change, e.g. \pounds9, compared with above the left-digit change, e.g. \pounds10. This exercise might compare investor $\times$ stock $\times$ days drawn from different investors. Therefore, we also conduct estimates that include individual fixed effects, thereby exploiting within-investor variation in the probability of sale either side of the left-digit change.

\ref{fig:left_digit_sell} illustrates the main result. Each panel shows the probability of a stock sale by the leftmost two digits of the stock price. Note, this pools over leftmost digits that are in pence, pounds, hundreds of pounds, and so on. The only information used in the analysis is the leftmost two digits, in integer values. The left-side plots pool all observations by the leftmost two digits and the probability of sale together with a 95\% confidence interval. The right-side plots show the probability of sale by leftmost two digits. Panel A shows an increase in the probability of sale when the price crosses the left-digit from below, Panel B shows an increase in the probability of sale when the price crosses the left-digit from above. \ref{fig:left_digit_sell_increase} and \ref{fig:left_digit_sell_decrease} reproduce these plots for subsamples by the price range of the stock, in Panel A up to \pounds1, in Panel B between \pounds1 and \pounds10, and in Panel C between \pounds10 and \pounds100.

We are confident that this pattern is not due to limit orders, because limit orders placed at left-digit thresholds would execute at that exact digit, thereby generating a spike only at X0. Instead, we see increased probability of sale at a range of digits above XO. This reflects the fact that investors do not continually monitor their accounts, so may only see a movement above X0 at the point in time the digit has increased to X1, X2, or so on.

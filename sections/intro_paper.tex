We show left-digit bias in stock-selling behavior of individual investors. Left-digit bias is the tendency to focus on the leftmost digit of a number while partially ignoring other digits (\citealp{poltrock1984comparative}). Our contribution is to show that investors are disproportionately attentive to the leftmost digit in their trading choices, the salience of prices matters for investment choices (is this what we think is going on?  This is similar to the rank effect finding of \cite{hartzmark2015}, whereby either top-ranked or bottom-ranked stocks by return since purchase are those most likely to be sold. We contribute to the broader literature on left-digit bias, including \cite{lacetera2012heuristic} and \cite{shlain2018more}. Our study contributes to our understanding of when and why investors sell stocks. 

\section{Data and Sample Selection}

We use the Barclays data. We first do some basic data cleaning, with details shown in \ref{tab:sample_selection}. 

We then choose a sample for analysis. A key element in our analysis is to draw a price increasing sample and a price decreasing sample, because we will show that the probability of sale increases with a change in the left digit both from below and from above. 

We define these samples as follows. First, using the example of price increasing, we identify the first day in each calendar quarter on which an investor made a login to their account. We then define the price increasing sample as the set of login days within the quarter for which the prices on subsequent login days were always above the price on the first day and the left-digit had changed within the quarter on at least one subsequent login-day. We define the price decreasing sample as the set of login days within the quarter for which the prices on subsequent login days were always below the price on the first day and the left-digit had changed within the quarter on at least one subsequent login-day. Our samples are based on quarters and individual $\times$  login days during the quarter. Due to the immense size of the data, we further restrict to a 30\% random sample.

The idea behind this sample restriction is that we need to focus on changes in left-digit that the investor actually saw. By restricting to changes in the left digit as seen by investors on login-days, we know that the investor saw the below-price and then subsequently the above-price (or vice versa).

We show later that results are unchanged when we modify the period that defines a sample to either a month or a year. 

Summary statistics are shown in \ref{tab:price_summary_stats_main}. Note, there are four units of left-digit in the data, pennies, tens of pennies, pounds and tens of pounds (there are only a few cases of hundreds of pounds). So, the left-digit changes of interest are pence to tens of pence, tens of pence to pounds, and pounds to tens of pounds (plus a few cases of tens of pounds to hundreds of pounds). Most stocks in the samples are prices in the range \pounds1.10 to \pounds10.10. A histogram of prices for all investor $\times$ login days is shown in \ref{fig:histogram_prices}.

\section{Results}

Our main result is shown in \ref{fig:left_digit_sell_main}. The figure stack all investor $\times$ stock $\times$ login days by the leftmost two digits. The figure plots in the left-side the probability of sale by leftmost digits, and in the right-side it plots the probability of sale by the leftmost two digits. For example, the left-side plot stacks up stocks which pass from 9 pence to 10 pence, 29 pence to 30 pence, 199 pence to 200 pence, and so on in every case in which the leftmost digit changes. These examples each enter the plot at X9 to Y0, where X and Y are integer units and $Y = X + 1$. The left-side plots show clear jumps in the probability of sale when the stock price crosses the leftmost digit; the right-side plots also show this phenomena, with the red bar denoting base 10 leftmost two digit prices. In Panel A there is a jump in probability of sale when the price crosses the left digit from below, e.g. 19 pence to 20 pence; in Panel B there is a jump when the price crosses the left digit from above, e.g. 20 pence to 19 pence. Note that in general the probability of sale is higher in the price increasing sample than in the price decreasing sample, consistent with the disposition effect. \ref{fig:left_digit_sell_increase_main} and \ref{fig:left_digit_sell_decrease_main} show that the left-digit effect occurs in each of the pennies, pounds and tens of pounds samples.

We estimate the size of the left-digit effect in \ref{tab:regressions_increase_main} and \ref{tab:regressions_decrease_main}. The regression setup is a discontinuity regression which pools all of the observations from the sample (increasing or decreasing) and regresses the probability of sale against a dummy for the price being above the left-digit change, plus continuous controls for the leftmost two digits below and above the left-digit change. The coefficient in Column 2 implies that a stock that has crossed the left-digit from below is 50\% more likely to be sold. The coefficient value is stable across specifications, including a rich specification in Column 5 that includes day, industry, account, and stock fixed effects. That specification therefore exploits within-investor, within-stock variation in the probability of sale, conditioning on day and industry differences \textcolor{blue}{EQ:[I will drop industry here, because it is accounted by the stocks]} in the likelihood of sale. In the price-decreasing sample the coefficient estimate in Column 1 implies a 25\% increase in probability of sale when the left-digit changes from above (note the coefficient are negative, reporting the effect of a change from below). \ref{tab:reg_subsamples_increase} and \ref{tab:reg_subsamples_decrease} report regressions from the subsamples by pennies, pounds and tens of pounds.

\subsection{Robustness}

We test for a variety of robustness concerns
\begin{itemize}
	\item Limit orders. The effect we see might in some cases be due to limit orders set at left-digit changes. However, while the strike price of the limit order would be at exactly the left-digit change, we see an elevated probability of sale across the range Y0 to Y5.
	\item Sample selection. We might be worried that our results are somehow due to sample selection. Therefore, we conduct a simulation analysis in which we assign sales randomly to investor $\times$ stock $\times$ days in each sample. \ref{fig:sample_selection_test} shows that with randomly allocated sales we see no evidence of discontinuity in the probability of sale when the leftmost digit changes.
	\item Quarter time period. One might worry that this also somehow creates a selection effect. We therefore conduct the same analysis, with the same results, on samples where the time period is defined as a month in \ref{fig:left_digit_sell_monthly} and as a year in \ref{fig:left_digit_sell_annual}. See \ref{tab:summary_stats_annual_monthly} for summary statistics and \ref{tab:price_increasing_monthly_annual} and \ref{tab:price_decreasing_monthly_annual} for regression estimates.
	\item Sell-day sample. We see the same result in the sell-day sample in \ref{fig:left_digit_sell}, with again the same patterns in sub-samples by pennies, pounds and tens of pounds in \ref{fig:left_digit_sell_increase_sellsample} and \ref{fig:left_digit_sell_decrease_sellsample}. See \ref{tab:regressions_sellsample_increase} and \ref{tab:regressions_sellsample_decrease} for regression estimates, plus \ref{tab:regression_sellsubsamples_increase} and \ref{tab:regression_sellsubsample_decrease} for regression estimates using the sub-samples by pennies, pounds and tens of pounds.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Investor Characteristics} 

We use sample splits and test for differences in the left-digit effect by various investor characteristics
\begin{itemize}
	\item Age: stronger among younger investors (\ref{tab:regressions_age_main}).
	\item Gender: no differences (\ref{tab:regressions_gender_main}).
	\item Portfolio value: stronger among small portfolios (\ref{tab:regressions_portvalue_main}).
	\item Tenure: stronger among younger accounts (\ref{tab:regressions_tenure_main}).
	\item Number of Stocks: stronger with fewer stocks (\ref{tab:regressions_numstocks_main}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Possible Extensions}

We should look at the robustness tests used by \cite{hartzmark2015} as some may be applicable here.

Can we say something about aggregate effects on investor behavior? The effect size in the regressions in very large, so maybe we see some aggregate effects? \textcolor{blue}{EQ:[but note that these analysis only work when we use login days. Using market days there is no pattern at all. So any aggregate analysis has to be restricted to login days]}

Other angles?


\textcolor{blue}{EQ: Additional exclusion: Linnainmaa (2010) develops a method to detect limit orders in a data set. By regressing a buy-versus-sell indicator (a dependent variable that takes the value of one when an investor sells a stock and the value of zero when an investor purchases a stock) against the daily return of an stock, for each investor, it is possible to detect investors using limit orders. The same-day return coefficient is significantly positive for limit-order trades, but significantly negative for market-order trades (individuals who	submit market orders often trade in the direction of the same-day return). We followed the same procedure and estimated return coefficients for each investor. To obtain reliable estimates, we included only investors with at least 10 trades, following Linnainmaa (2010). Panel D excluded all investors with a positive and significant coefficient, 3,021 investors.}

Panels display different sample restrictions to exclude sells corresponding to limit orders. Panel A drops sells executed when the market was closed. It also exclude potential discretionary trades (high frequency trades executed on the same stock, at the same time and at the same price that would likely correspond to sells arranged by Barclays discretionary service). Panel B excludes sells with a preceding login day. Panel C exclude non-liquid stocks, and Panel D excludes potential limit orders following Linnainmaa (2010) methodology. Panel A drops 2.2\% of sells, Panel B drops 64.7\% of sells, Panel C drops 75.9\% of sells, and Panel D drops 11.4\% of sells.}
